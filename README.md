As the players struggle to decipher the puzzle, they turn to Boblin for help.

You can press **"H"** button to show additional button that plays Boblin's melody

Each button on the tablet corresponds to a diffrent **note**. When pressed the button lights up and a note is played.

To solve the puzzle, the party must **replicate the melody Boblin played** by pressing the correct sequence.

On correct input all buttons **lights up** and the sound of a secret stone door opening is played
